PIE INFOCOMM Internship

The main topic is prediction using machine learning technics. Machine learning is widely used now a days in many business applications like e-commerce and many more. Prediction is one of area where this machine learning used, our topic is about prediction of heart stroke by processing patientâ€™s dataset and a data of patients to whom we need to predict the chance of occurrence of a heart stroke disease. The aim is to achieve better accuracy and to make the system more efficient so that it can predict the chances of heart stroke.

Heart Stroke Prediction Using K-Neighbors Classifier and Random Forest Classifier

K-Neighbors Classifier:
1. The K-Neighbors Classifier (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by identifying the 'k' nearest data points in the feature space to a given input and classifying 
   it based on the majority class among those neighbors.
2. In the context of heart stroke prediction, KNN can be used to classify whether a patient is likely to experience a stroke based on various features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other 
  health indicators.
3. The algorithm is sensitive to the choice of 'k' (the number of neighbors) and the distance metric used (e.g., Euclidean distance). It is important to standardize the data to ensure that all features contribute 
  equally to the distance calculations.

Random Forest Classifier:
1. The Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of their predictions for classification tasks. It is known for its 
   robustness and ability to handle overfitting.
2. For heart stroke prediction, the Random Forest algorithm can analyze complex interactions between features and provide insights into which factors are most important in predicting stroke risk.
3. This classifier is particularly effective in dealing with large datasets and can handle both numerical and categorical data. It also provides feature importance scores, which can help in understanding the key 
  predictors of stroke.

Data Import and Visualization:
The heart stroke dataset can be imported from sources like Kaggle in CSV format. Once imported into a Jupyter Notebook, exploratory data analysis (EDA) can be performed to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
Visualization techniques such as histograms and correlation heatmaps can be used to represent the data graphically. Histograms help in understanding the distribution of individual features (e.g., age distribution), while heatmaps can illustrate the correlation between different features, aiding in feature selection and model interpretation.


Model Evaluation:
After training the models, their performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices can also be used to visualize the performance of the classifiers in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
By utilizing K-Neighbors Classifier and Random Forest Classifier, researchers can effectively predict the likelihood of heart strokes based on patient data, ultimately aiding in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures.
